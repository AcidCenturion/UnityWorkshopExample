I'm a computer science major, so... I'll explain everything in the comments of the code.

It might look a bit lengthy and complicated at first, but trust me, they're actually really
small pieces of code - like 10 or so lines. The rest is just my comments haha.

I recommend looking into the TopDownMove script first. Its the simpler of the two as we don't take
into account any physics yet (well, technically it's being applied and stuff since we have the
Rigidbody2D component). 

After you get a good grasp of how the script receives input to control movement, take a look
at the PlatformerMove script. Now we start adding some jump tracking and a little more physics.

After that, there's a bit of a challenge I leave to you programmers to really sell these controls.
Don't get discouraged if you have to compile 5, 10, or 20+ times before your code starts to work.
That's part of the programming process, and when you finally get it right, I promise it will
feel so rewarding when you see it come alive in the game preview window.

Of course, there's plenty more things you can do that I can't reasonably showcase,
so now's a good time to learn how to read documentation.
