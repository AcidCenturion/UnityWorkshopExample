Ok, don't let the scary name intimidate you.
While Prefabs sound like a really complicated thing, I promise you its really, really quite simple.
I'm so confident in this being simple that I guarantee you that this is my shortest notes doc.

Are you ready?


* A Prefab... is just object copy and paste. *


Yup. You can easily create a prefab by dragging an object from the Object Hierarchy in a Scene
and drop it into the Prefab folder. Boom, done. You now have a prefab.

Whenever you want, you can drag that Prefab from the prefab folder into a Scene's Object Hierarchy
to add it to the scene. When you do, the object will retain all the same components and values
(including the location coordinates, so if you place it in the same scene as the original it might
overlap with each other).

Prefabs are great to save time when you have multiple levels and you need to place the player 
object in all the levels. Or if you have an object that reappears several times in a level.
