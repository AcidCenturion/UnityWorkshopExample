Hi! I'm Michael. I'll be hosting the Unity Workshop this semester.

This is a downloadable Unity project that I will use as a guideline for the workshop. Please install this ahead of time, so that you may use this as a template to start your own experiments in the Unity engine! Feel free to copy the code from this project, as its pretty hard to make a game have functionality without code (and I understand that not everyone in this workshop is a CSC major). Or, go ahead and just make new scenes directly in this project and reuse the assets I've included.


vvvvv GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS vvvvv

If you're unfamiliar with how to install from GitHub, I've included some instructions below:

1. See that big green [ <> Code v ] button a little up and right from here? Click it and it should open a drop down menu

2. At the bottom of that dropdown, there should be a Download ZIP option. Pick that and it should begin a download to your computer.

3. And that's it! You now have a local and personal copy of this project. Hooray!


vvvvv UNITY INSTRUCTIONS vvvvv


Next you're going to want to add the project to Unity Hub. This project runs in Unity version 6000.0.60f1.
You can install that first, but if you add the project following my steps, Unity Hub will auto prompt a download:

1. In the Unity Hub's Projects tab, there's an [ Add v ] button next to the big blue [ + New project ] button. Clicking the Add button opens a dropdown menu.

2. Select Add project from disk option. 
2-1. This will reference the location in your files that you have the project. Move your downloaded ZIP of the project to a location that works for your organization. Any folder will do, some psychopaths put it in their Windows Music folder >_> *yeah you know who you are*
2-2. Once you picked a location, unzip the project by right clicking and selecting Extract.

3. Find where you stored your project folder. You will want to make sure you select the folder Workshop Demo, not just the UnityWorkshopExample folder.
Sidenote. The Workshop Demo folder is the actual Unity project. UnityWorkshopExample folder is just what I named the thing to hold it and upload it to GitHub. The correct project folder should have folders like Assets, Library, Logs, Packages, etc. inside of it.

4. Once you've selected the folder, it should add it to the projects list. At this point, you're technically finished adding the project to your Unity Hub. yay! ... but I did say "technically"

5. You'll need the correct Unity version to open, work in, and run the project. Unity Hub should list 6000.0.60f1 as the Editor Version. You could, if you want, update the project to a more recent version that you may already have installed. Generally, it should work the same but sometimes it won't. Or, you could install the 6000.0.60f1 Editor version.

6a. If you try to open the project it should tell you to install the editor version. Just follow Unity's on screen steps and it should install no problem! I do recommend doing this earlier than the actual workshop though, as Unity versions take awhile to install.

6b. But, say you're currently sat in front of me at the actual workshop and don't have time to download that specific version of Unity. Then you can update the project's version by selecting the (probably warning signed) 6000.0.60f1 version button, and it will open a menu of all your current installations of Unity. Hopefully you have at least a version, so you can try to update the project to a more recent version of the Editor by selecting you version and clicking the blue button on the bottom.

With that, now you should be able to open and view the Workshop Demo project. Enjoy!
